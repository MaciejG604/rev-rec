# Optimal-Recommendations-for-Source-Code-Reviews
This thesis will focus on evaluating several alternatives for the recommendation of the most appropriate reviewer for software code changes, providing a prototype that can be used to test several algorithms.

#### Milestones:
1. [RevFinder] (http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7081824/) Implementation. (01.11.2016)
2. [ReviewBot] (https://labs.vmware.com/download/198/) Implementation. (13.11.2016 (still in progress, beacause of problems to get necessary data from Gerrit))
3. Think about / implement if possible some other approaches, analyze [this](http://rosaec.snu.ac.kr/publish/2009/techmemo/ROSAEC-2009-006.pdf) or [this](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/dccb/1f1d6490b44f930b2413d1a1aa1b471478df.pdf) or some other techniques of reviewers recommendation systems + proposal of some new approach with possible benefits. (04.12.2016)
4. Implementation of a prototype with a new proposed approach, that should bring some benefits over state of the art. (31.12.2016)
5. Improve the prototype and execute tests on open source software projects providing an experimental evaluation. (29.01.2017)
6. Finish all implementation parts of the thesis, improve it as much as possible and implement some GUI (when it would make sense). (28.02.2017) 
7. Prepare the outline of written part of the thesis. (12.03.2017)
8. Finish the thesis. (14.05.2017)
